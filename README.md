# StrPermutations
Creates a list of strings by making permutations from another list of strings



Step1: write in input.txt a list of words to start with. 1 word/string per line
Step2: Check MAX_LEN and set it to whatever you want - MAX LEN is used to limit number of output. Outputted strings will have length < MAX_LEN, bigger strings are ignored. 
Step 3: run permutations.py
Step 4: find the output in the output file
